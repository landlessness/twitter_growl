h1. Twitter Growl

I just want to receive growl notifications when my friends update their twitter statuses and I don't want to install the memory hog that is Twitterific.

h2. Installation

# Edit the config.yml file and update it with your Twitter username and 
   password
# Add a cronjob:

<blockquote><pre><code>
  # twitter-growl
  */5 * * * * twitter-growl/twitter_growl.rb
</code></pre></blockquote>
